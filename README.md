Getting Started | Tensorflow tutorials on Windows using the GPU

A collection of writing along with the tutorials presented here https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/. 
Done using a virtual environment with conda to run python3.5 and gpu-enabled tensorflow on Windows 10.

# Scripts overview
test_gpu.py | Short little script to show whether the gpu is used at all

softmax_mnist.py | A softmax regression on the MNIST dataset (~92% accuracy)

convolution_mnist.py | A more complex convolutional neural network on the MNIST dataset (~99.2% accuracy)
